# MultipleRegression_fromScratch and 3D Visualization

### Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of multiple linear regression from scratch using Python. It not only provides a clear step-by-step explanation but also enhances understanding through animations and 3D visualizations. Multiple linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm that models the relationship between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable. Understanding its inner workings and gradient descent optimization is crucial for any aspiring data scientist or machine learning enthusiast.  [Check it out](MultipleRegression_fromScratch)
